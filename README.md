# parano.sty
A LaTeX package for numbering paragraphs.
Taken from https://github.com/HugoAreias/DRAW--includes-DREQL-/blob/master/Manual/parano.sty, originally developed by CV Radhakrishnan

## Features
The current version just counts all the paragraphs, giving all of them a unique number.
This is useful for revisioning, especially reverse outlining.

## Todo
- current version breaks \paragraph{}, the paragraph name is not displayed.
- current version does not work properly with csquotes' \blockcquote (and probably other blockquoting)
- current version sometimes messes up the indentation
